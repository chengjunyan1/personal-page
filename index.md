## About Me

TEST123S

I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in deep learning at Dartmouth College. 
My research centred on these questions:
1. Agent that can run forever
2. Autonomous agent that can do anything without human intervention
3. Agent that can really extrapolate beyond "itself" or "priors" (including training data, inductive biases, human instructions, encoded problem structures, etc.)

These goals may lead to the answer of these mind experiments:
1. If we send an AI to Mars, and check it after 10 years, is it still running or
  crashed? Will it be able to construct a city there?
2. If we have a time machine and send a "tabula rasa" AI to the age before
  sapiens were born, will it be able to reconstruct human civilization?
3. In your childhood, when you go back home, your mom will cook for you, your
  dad may clean the house. And you just play with your toys and friends, and you
  don't need to run the household. Now, if we let the AI to run the "house" or
  even the society and leave it alone, can it do well, can we trust it?
