## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, fully funded by [PhD Innovation Fellowship](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/graduate/phdi) (Thayer & Tuck collaborative, hosted by [Dr. Eric R. Fossum](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/eric-fossum)). 
I interned in the [AIIL Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/ai-interaction-and-learning/) at [**Microsoft Research Redmond**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), mentored by [Dr. Jay Stokes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jstokes/), on ***autonomous software engineering***, and 6 months at the [**Allen Institute for AI (Ai2)**](https://allenai.org/) under [Dr. Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. 

### About My Research
I build complex LLM-agentic systems across forecasting, scientific discovery, software design, and sociotal dynamics. Below are ***live demos*** of my flagship systems (click to explore):

My goal is to achieve autonomous systems that can *accurately*, *reliably*, and *efficiently* take over critical real-world domains in long-term large-scale deployments, with a holographic perception of the world dynamics. I focus on ***Hybrid and Neural-symbolic AI*** that enhances powerful NNs and LLMs with symbolic approaches, such as logic, statistics, programming, and optimization (*why we still need symbols? it's like why we need laws!*). 


<!--
I am especially interested in *Social Science*, *Scientific Discovery*, and *Robotics*.

ðŸŒŒ *I seriously care about how AI/robotics can make a fairer, happier, and efficient society, as it is not simply a problem of better automation or higher productivity!*

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, with full funding from [PhD Innovation Fellowship](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/graduate/phdi) (Thayer & Tuck collaborative program, hosted by [Dr. Eric R. Fossum](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/eric-fossum)). I interned for 6 months at the [Allen Institute for AI (Ai2)](https://allenai.org/) under [Dr. Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. My research is driven by the goal of developing and understanding the foundations of **autonomous**, **trustworthy**, and **scalable** intelligent systems capable of *robustly* tackling *complex* real-world problems. It is based on my visions of the future relationship between AI, humans, and the world, that may be made possible with such systems as foundations (difficulty ascending):
1. *Specialized AGI (my goal)*: Be safely entrusted with social systemsâ€”economics, law, finance, production, and research.
2. *Independant AGI (my "imagination")*: Developing and sustaining another planet independently for 50 years before human arrival...
3. *"True" AGI (by my standard)*: Rediscover human-level (symbolic) knowledge and beyond from *"tabula rasa"* even if sent back to the pre-Sapien era.
   
*... and so on.*

To answer it, my work focuses on two weaved ideas: 1) **Neurosymbolic Learning**, including compositional representation ([ICLR'24 Poster](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uqxBTcWRnj)), program synthesis, neurosymbolic programming, and 2) **Phylogenetic Intelligence**, such as Lifelong Multi LLM Agents ([ICLR'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s9z0HzWJJp)), evolutionary and game-theoretic methods, online ensemble learning. Around complex real-world applications, like Automated Scientific Problem-Solving at Ai2, social science ([FinAI@ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17266) for asset pricing). In the past, I have also worked on robotics, multimodal learning, and deep program understanding & analysis.

<!-- ## Miscellaneous


I love traveling, photography, and hiking/adventures with friends! In my spare time, I watch movies, operas, and games. My favorite directors are Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa. I have a deep and broad interest in history, classical music, and art, especially architecture, although I am not an expert.
I have been enjoying the blurring of the boundary between photography and classical paintings in a harmonious way, which are usually regarded as two opposites, realistic vs romantic. Barry Lyndon offers a good example, that's also my favorite movie. Overall, I wish to explore the world and capture it with light and shadow while infusing humanistic beauty. 
Besides, I have also traded US stocks and other financial derivatives for a long time since my freshman, starting with my undergraduate investment club.
