## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, currently interning at the [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/) with [Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. My research is driven by the goal of developing and understanding the foundations of **autonomous** and **evolving** intelligent systems capable of robustly tackling complex real-world problems with minimal human intervention. Here are some thought experiments related to this vision:
1. How can we build a learning system that, from *"tabula rasa,"* could rediscover human (symbolic) knowledge if sent back to the pre-sapiens era?
2. How can we create AI agents that could be safely entrusted with managing social systemsâ€”economics, law, production, and even research?
3. How can we design an autonomous system that could develop independently on another planet for 50 years, without any human assistance?
*... and so on.*

While multifaceted, these challenges converge on a core question: **How can an AI system stably extrapolate *new* or *improved* "information" that extends beyond its "priors" (such as data, inductive biases, and prompts) in *complex* settings?** To answer it, I have explored "Lifelong LLM Agents" for complex social systems ([ICLR'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s9z0HzWJJp), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17266)), "Compositional Neural-Symbolic Representation" ([ICLR'24 Poster](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uqxBTcWRnj)). At present, I am focused on using LLMs to autonomously address scientific problems across domains like language modeling, social science, and the natural/formal sciences.
