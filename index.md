## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in deep learning at Dartmouth College. 
My research is centered on developing the Lifelong Large Language Model agents, designed for practical implementation in real society. I aim to integrate compositional memory and neural symbolic reasoning, thereby enhancing the agent's capabilities. A key focus is its application in asset management and pricing, where the agent is expected to continuously build up its own experience, insights, and knowledge in the life-long run, while also necessitating a blend of classic quantitative methods with language-driven qualitative analysis, catering to the complex and dynamic nature of societal and market environments. Additionally, I am exploring the 'human-in-the-loop' aspect, examining how trust and understanding between clients and fiduciary LLM agents evolve throughout the asset management lifecycle.
<!-- I study Large Language Model (LLM) based lifelong autonomous agents for real society with a focus on the user-in-the-loop **Autonomous Personal Asset Management**. I dive into compositional representation learning and neural symbolic learning to enhance the long-term memory and hybrid reasoning power of the agent.  -->

## Research Interests

- **Lifelong LLM Agents:** Human-in-the-loop lifelong LLM agents that can be applied in real society.
- **Compositional Representation:** Hierarchical and mixed long-term memory system.
- **Neural-Symbolic Learning:** Hybrid intelligent system that incorporates expert tools.
<!-- - **Asset Pricing:** Combining LLM and classic methods in asset pricing. -->
