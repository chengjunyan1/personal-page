## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, I interned 6 months at the [Allen Institute for AI (Ai2)](https://allenai.org/) under [Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. My research is driven by the goal of developing and understanding the foundations of **autonomous** and **trustworthy** intelligent systems capable of *robustly* tackling *complex* real-world problems. These systems are interactable, personalizable, and large-scale long-term deployable. Imagine these future scenarios that may be made possible with such systems as foundations (difficulty ascending):
1. Be safely entrusted with social systemsâ€”economics, law, finance, production, and research.
2. Developing and sustaining another planet independently for 50 years before human arrival.
3. Rediscover human (symbolic) knowledge from *"tabula rasa"* if sent back to the pre-Sapien era.
*... and so on.*

To answer it, my work focuses on two core areas: 1) **Neurosymbolic Learning**, including compositional representation ([ICLR'24 Poster](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uqxBTcWRnj)), program synthesis, theorem proving and 2) **Phylogenetic Intelligence**, such as Lifelong Multi LLM Agents ([ICLR'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s9z0HzWJJp)), evolutionary and game-theoretic methods, as well as online ensemble learning. Around complex real-world applications, like Automated Scientific Problem-Solving at Ai2, social science ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17266) for asset pricing). In the past, I have also worked on robotics, multimodal learning, and deep learning for code.

I love movies, classical music, opera, computer games, hiking, and random walks. My favorite directors include Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, and Martin Scorsese.
