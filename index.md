## About Me

I am a second-year Ph.D. student in deep learning at Dartmouth College. I study Large Language Model (LLM) -based lifelong autonomous agents for real society with a focus on user-in-the-loop personal asset management. I dive into compositional representation learning and neural symbolic learning to enhance the long-term memory and hybrid reasoning power of the agent. 

## Research Interests

- **Lifelong LLM Socio-Agents:** Human-in-the-loop lifelong LLM agents for real society.
- **Compositional Representation:** Hierarchical and mixed long-term memory system.
- **Neural-Symbolic Learning:** Hybrid intelligent system that incorporates expert tools.
