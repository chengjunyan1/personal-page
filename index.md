## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, fully funded by [PhD Innovation Fellowship](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/graduate/phdi) (Thayer & Tuck collaborative, hosted by [Dr. Eric R. Fossum](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/eric-fossum)). 
I am currently a research intern at [**Microsoft Research Redmond**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/), working with [Dr. Jay Stokes](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jstokes/), on ***autonomous software engineering***.
I interned for 6 months at the [**Allen Institute for AI (Ai2)**](https://allenai.org/) under [Dr. Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. 

About my research:
* **Goal:** **Autonomous Complex Problem Solving**, build intelligent systems that can *stably*, *trustworthily*, and *scalably* solve complex real-world problems for long-term large-scale deployment.
* **Approach:** **Neural Symbolic Program Synthesis**, I combine the powerful LLM agent synthesizers with symbolic approaches, including logical, program analysis, and optimization methods.
* **Applications:** I am especially interested in *Financial **Economics***, *Software Engineering*, *Scientific Discovery*, and *Robotics*.

I also seriously care about how AI can make a fairer, Pareto-efficient society, as this is not simply a problem of better automation or higher productivity.

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, with full funding from [PhD Innovation Fellowship](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/graduate/phdi) (Thayer & Tuck collaborative program, hosted by [Dr. Eric R. Fossum](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/eric-fossum)). I interned for 6 months at the [Allen Institute for AI (Ai2)](https://allenai.org/) under [Dr. Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. My research is driven by the goal of developing and understanding the foundations of **autonomous**, **trustworthy**, and **scalable** intelligent systems capable of *robustly* tackling *complex* real-world problems. It is based on my visions of the future relationship between AI, humans, and the world, that may be made possible with such systems as foundations (difficulty ascending):
1. *Specialized AGI (my goal)*: Be safely entrusted with social systemsâ€”economics, law, finance, production, and research.
2. *Independant AGI (my "imagination")*: Developing and sustaining another planet independently for 50 years before human arrival...
3. *"True" AGI (by my standard)*: Rediscover human-level (symbolic) knowledge and beyond from *"tabula rasa"* even if sent back to the pre-Sapien era.
   
*... and so on.*

To answer it, my work focuses on two weaved ideas: 1) **Neurosymbolic Learning**, including compositional representation ([ICLR'24 Poster](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uqxBTcWRnj)), program synthesis, neurosymbolic programming, and 2) **Phylogenetic Intelligence**, such as Lifelong Multi LLM Agents ([ICLR'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s9z0HzWJJp)), evolutionary and game-theoretic methods, online ensemble learning. Around complex real-world applications, like Automated Scientific Problem-Solving at Ai2, social science ([FinAI@ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17266) for asset pricing). In the past, I have also worked on robotics, multimodal learning, and deep program understanding & analysis.

<!-- ## Miscellaneous


I love traveling, photography, and hiking/adventures with friends! In my spare time, I watch movies, operas, and games. My favorite directors are Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa. I have a deep and broad interest in history, classical music, and art, especially architecture, although I am not an expert.
I have been enjoying the blurring of the boundary between photography and classical paintings in a harmonious way, which are usually regarded as two opposites, realistic vs romantic. Barry Lyndon offers a good example, that's also my favorite movie. Overall, I wish to explore the world and capture it with light and shadow while infusing humanistic beauty. 
Besides, I have also traded US stocks and other financial derivatives for a long time since my freshman, starting with my undergraduate investment club.
