## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, currently interning at the [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/) with [Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. My research is driven by the goal of developing and understanding the foundations of **autonomous** and **evolving** intelligent systems capable of robustly tackling complex real-world problems. Here are some thought experiments related to this vision, how can we design the systems that can:
1. Rediscover human (symbolic) knowledge from *"tabula rasa,"* if sent back to the pre-Sapiens era?
2. Be safely entrusted with social systemsâ€”economics, law, production, and even academia?
3. Be tasked with developing another planet for 50 years before human arrival?
*... and so on.*

While multifaceted, they converge on a core question: **How to consistently extrapolate *new* or *improved* information that extends beyond the "priors" (such as data, inductive biases, and prompts) in *complex* settings?** To answer it, I have explored "Lifelong LLM Agents" for social dynamics ([ICLR'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s9z0HzWJJp), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17266)), "Compositional Neural-Symbolic Representation" ([ICLR'24 Poster](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uqxBTcWRnj)). At present, I am focused on using LLMs and evolutionary algorithms to autonomously address scientific problems.
