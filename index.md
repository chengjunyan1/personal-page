## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, I spent 6 months interning at the [Allen Institute for AI (AI2)](https://allenai.org/) with [Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. My research is driven by the goal of developing and understanding the foundations of **autonomous** and **evolving** intelligent systems capable of *robustly* tackling *complex* real-world problems. Those systems are interactable, personalizable, and large-scale long-term deployable. Here are some thought experiments that imply this vision—how can we design systems that can:
1. Rediscover human (symbolic) knowledge from *"tabula rasa"* if sent back to the pre-sapien era?
2. Be safely entrusted with social systems—economics, law, production, and even academia?
3. Be tasked with developing another planet for 50 years before human arrival?
*... and so on.*

While multifaceted, they converge on a core question: **How to stably extrapolate *new* or *improved* information that extends beyond the "priors" (e.g., data, inductive biases, and prompts) in *complex* settings?** To answer it, I am exploring 1) Phylogenetic Intelligence, such as **Lifelong LLM Agents** ([ICLR'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s9z0HzWJJp) & [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17266) for societal dynamics), 2) compositional **Neural-Symbolic Learning** ([ICLR'24 Poster](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uqxBTcWRnj)), and 3) Complex real-world applications, like **Automated Scientific Problem-Solving** with LLMs and evolutionary algorithms at present. In the past, I have also worked on robotics, multimodal learning, and deep learning for code.

I love movies, classical music, opera, computer games, hiking, and random walks. My favorite directors include Stanley Kubrick, Akira Kurosawa, and Martin Scorsese.
