## About Me

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate at Dartmouth College, with full funding from [PhD Innovation Fellowship](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/graduate/phdi). I interned for 6 months at the [Allen Institute for AI (Ai2)](https://allenai.org/) under [Kyle Richardson](https://www.nlp-kyle.com/) on ***autonomous scientific discovery***. My research is driven by the goal of developing and understanding the foundations of **autonomous**, **trustworthy**, and **scalable** intelligent systems capable of *robustly* tackling *complex* real-world problems. It is based on my visions of the future relationship between AI, humans, and the world, that may be made possible with such systems as foundations (difficulty ascending):
1. *Specialized AGI (my goal)*: Be safely entrusted with social systemsâ€”economics, law, finance, production, and research.
2. *Independant AGI (my imagination)*: Developing and sustaining another planet independently for 50 years before human arrival...
3. *"True" AGI (my standard)*: Rediscover human-level (symbolic) knowledge and beyond from *"tabula rasa"* even if sent back to the pre-Sapien era.
*... and so on.*

To answer it, my work focuses on two weaved ideas: 1) **Neurosymbolic Learning**, including compositional representation ([ICLR'24 Poster](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uqxBTcWRnj)), program synthesis, neurosymbolic programming, and 2) **Phylogenetic Intelligence**, such as Lifelong Multi LLM Agents ([ICLR'24 Spotlight](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=s9z0HzWJJp)), evolutionary and game-theoretic methods, online ensemble learning. Around complex real-world applications, like Automated Scientific Problem-Solving at Ai2, social science ([FinAI@ICLR'25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17266) for asset pricing). In the past, I have also worked on robotics, multimodal learning, and deep learning for code.

I love traveling, photography, and hiking/adventures with friends! In my spare time, I watch movies and operas. My favorite directors are Stanley Kubrick and Akira Kurosawa. I have a deep and broad interest in history, classical music, and art, especially architecture, although I am not an expert.
I have been enjoying the blurring of the boundary between photography and classical paintings in a harmonious way, which are usually regarded as two opposites, realistic vs romantic. Barry Lyndon offers a good example, that's also my favorite movie. Overall, I wish to explore the world and capture it with light and shadow while infusing humanistic beauty. 
Besides, I have also traded US stocks and other financial derivatives for a long time since my freshman, starting with my undergraduate investment club.
