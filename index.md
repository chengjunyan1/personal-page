## About Me

I am a 3rd-year Ph.D. candidate in deep learning and AI at Dartmouth College. I have been interning at the Allen Institute for AI (Ai2) since June 2024. My long-term research goal is to explore the foundations of a truly **autonomous** and **evolving** intelligent system—capable of independently operating in complex real-world scenarios over extended periods, with minimal to no human intervention.

Consider these "naive" thought experiments which necessitate such a system:
1. If we could send a *"tabula rasa"* AI back to the era before Homo sapiens, would it re-discover human knowledge?
2. Could AI safely and robustly be deligated to operate social systems—Economics, Law, Production, etc. —without human oversight?
3. If an AI *with any priors* were deployed to another planet, could it survive and develop like humans on Earth?

Those are complicated and multifaceted challenges, while hinge on a foundational question: **Can an AI system constantly explore *new* or *improving* "knowledge" that extends beyond its "priors" (such as data, inductive biases, and prompts) in *complex* open or close-ended settings?** Around this vision, I have explored topics like "Lifelong LLM Agents" for complex social systems (ICLR'24 Spotlight, arXiv) and "Compositional Neural-Symbolic Representation" (ICLR'24 Poster). Recently, I have been specifically interested in autonomous scientific discovery using LLMs and evolution algorithms (ongoing with Ai2).
